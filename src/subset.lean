/- The image of a map betweens sets is a subset of the codomain. We show this in several steps:
   * First, we show that [total_image] from [function] is a set. This works more generally: 
     A sigma type whose dependent components are sets is a set. It can be shown for n-types 
     using the results in [hit.trunc] on truncations of sigma types. 
   * Second, we construct a map from [total_image] into the codomain and show that it is 
     injective.
   * Now we have all the ingredients to construct the image as a subset of the codomain. -/

   The core of the construction of this equivalence is that there may be many bijections
